# Bankruptcy Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project for predicting corporate bankruptcy based on financial indicators.

---

## Introduction

Predicting company bankruptcy is a high-stakes financial task with implications for investors, creditors, and regulatory bodies. Early detection of financial distress can help mitigate economic fallout. This project aims to build predictive models that classify whether a company is at risk of bankruptcy using financial statement data.

# Data & Preprocessing
## Project Overview

- **Prediction Target:** Binary classification – Bankrupt vs. Non-Bankrupt.
- **Scope:** Publicly listed companies in Taiwan from 1999 to 2009.
- **Environment:** Local Jupyter notebooks using pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

## Data Sources

### Source: Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ)
- Covers 6,819 companies over 10 years.
- 95 original financial features (ratios and indicators).
- Excludes financial sector firms to avoid structural bias.

## Preprocessing Pipeline
![alt text](images/bankruptcy-dataflow.png)
### Stage 1: Ingest
- Adjusted feature scales via standardization (z-score) using training set stats.
- Filtered correlated features (Pearson r > 0.9), reducing to 76 features.

### Stage 2: Modeling Prep
- Labels constructed as binary indicators of bankruptcy.
- Dataset split: 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test (stratified).
- Standardization applied using training data mean and std to prevent leakage.

## Feature Engineering

### Target Variable
- Binary target: 1 = Bankrupt, 0 = Non-bankrupt (defined per TEJ rules).

### Core Features
- Numerical: Liquidity ratios, profitability ratios, leverage indicators.
- Key examples: Total Debt/Net Worth, Persistent EPS, Borrowing Dependency.

### Feature Selection
- Removed 19 highly correlated features.
- Final model trained on 76 features.

# Modeling

## Problem Framing

- **Type:** Binary classification.
- **Challenge:** Severe class imbalance (only 3.2% of companies are bankrupt).

## Models Considered

- Logistic Regression (baseline and neural)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- Balanced Random Forest
![alt text](images/bankruptcy-baseline-confmatrix.png)
## Training Details

- Batch size: 32 (for Keras models)
- Epochs: 20
- Optimizer: Adam (learning rate 0.01 for Keras)
- Class balancing: Class weighting, SMOTE, ADASYN

## Evaluation

### Metrics
- Focused on: Recall, Precision, F1-score (especially for minority class), ROC AUC.
- Accuracy alone is misleading due to imbalance.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

- False Negatives: 8 missed bankruptcies – small but critical.
- Misclassification costs discussed in conclusions.

# Conclusion & Future Work

This project showed that a Balanced Random Forest with tuned parameters could capture 86% of bankrupt companies while maintaining reasonable precision. Feature analysis revealed leverage and earnings stability as core bankruptcy drivers.

### Future Work:
- Test additional sampling methods (e.g., Tomek Links, SMOTE-ENN).
- Explore LSTM or Transformer-based models on financial time series.
- Incorporate macroeconomic indicators or textual sentiment data.
